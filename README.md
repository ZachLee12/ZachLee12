### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Zach. An IT-enthusiast who is always curious to know more! I am currently in my second year of my Bachelor's degree in the field of computer science. I really enjoy learning full-stack development and frameworks to enhance my projects. During my free time, I like to build personal projects and if the weather allows, an adventurous hike in the mountains.
